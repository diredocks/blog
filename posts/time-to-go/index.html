    <h1>Time to Go</h1>

    

    <p>I often find myself reflecting on moments from the past. I know there&rsquo;s always a voice in my head saying, &lsquo;Understanding your past is essential for reaching the future.&rsquo; But let’s be honest: every time I revisit my unfinished projects or failures, all I feel is regret—nothing more.</p>
<p>To open your mind means to filter out the noise around you, including echoes from the past. We need to focus on what lies ahead and recognize that we can&rsquo;t change history.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I stumble upon some beautiful 80s Japanese City Pop music online. Many of these songs have been forgotten over time, and I can&rsquo;t help but sigh, &lsquo;What a pity!&rsquo; But we must keep moving forward; we don’t want to be part of &lsquo;Tears of the times&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The best time to plant a tree was 30 years ago, the second best time is now.</p>
