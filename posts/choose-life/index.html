  <p>We can’t really do much in this day and age, not for regular people—those with just average looks, intelligence, or money. Back when I was in junior high, my biology teacher said birds are constantly on the hunt for food, day and night, without rest. Aren’t we a lot like those little creatures?</p>
<p>Building a hobby requires time, money, and attention—resources most of us don’t have in abundance. Losing touch with hobbies shuts down many opportunities for us. We miss out on connecting with a broader social circle, gaining real-life experiences, and truly enjoying life. It paints a pretty pessimistic picture.</p>
<p>I believe most of us are stuck in a certain mindset: we&rsquo;re tired of the lives we lead but not brave enough to make a change. The positive changes we&rsquo;re told to pursue are often the ones we&rsquo;re least willing to make, and that creates a dilemma. I mean, if it’s something you truly want, why haven’t you taken even a single step forward?</p>
<p>Modern humans are submerged in experiences crafted by the system around us. The idea of a &ldquo;decent life&rdquo; has been planted in our minds. Our desires are programmed, our love and passion—everything—feels plastic and unreal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Choose life.<br>
Choose a job.<br>
Choose a career.<br>
Choose a family, Choose a fucking big television.<br>
Choose washing machines, cars, compact disc players, and electrical tin openers.<br>
Choose good health, low cholesterol and dental insurance.<br>
Choose fixed-interest mortgage repayments.<br>
Choose a starter home.<br>
Choose your friends.<br>
Choose leisure wear and matching luggage.<br>
Choose a three piece suite on hire purchase in a range of fucking fabrics.<br>
Choose DIY and wondering who you are on a Sunday morning.<br>
Choose sitting on that couch watching mind-numbing spirit-crushing game shows, stuffing fucking junk food into your mouth.<br>
Choose rotting away at the end of it all, pishing you last in a miserable home, nothing more than an embarrassment to the selfish, fucked-up brats you have spawned to replace yourself.<br>
Choose your future.<br>
Trainspotting - 1996</p>

<p>I choose not to choose life: I choose something else.</p>
